\section{Ramseyfication and beyond: generalised profunctors}
\label{sec:org50db6c2}
We can generalise the definition above to encompass Ramsey sentences:
\begin{definition}\label{mn_ramsey}
	Let $\clT,\clO$ be two categories; a \emph{Ramsey map}, or a \emph{$(n,m)$-ary Ramsey map} is a profunctor $\fkK : \clT^n \pto \clO^m$; note that we allow $n,m$ to be zero; in that case, $\clA^0$ is understood to be the terminal category $\boldsymbol{1}$.
\end{definition}
The intuition behind this definition is as follows: given $\uT\in\clT^n, \uO\in\clO^m$, the set $\fkK(\uT, \uO)$ represents the type of proofs that the observational tuple $\uO$ admits a description in terms of the theoretical tuple $\uT$.

This formalism allows to speak about particular worlds, obtained as presheaf categories over observational $\clO$; if $\clT, \clO$ is a theoretical pair, we can instantiate \autoref{nervereal} above in the particular case where $\clW = [\clO^\op, \Set]$ (observe that in this case $\clW$ is a Yaldabaoth). We can thus address a certain number of questions, arising from the canonical adjunction obtained by virtue of \autoref{equ_prof_cocont}:% and \autoref{}:
\[
	\xymatrix{ [(\clO^m)^\op, \Set] \ar@<3pt>[r] & \ar@<3pt>[l] [(\clT^n)^\op, \Set];}
\]
It is worth to mention that since the diagram
\[
	\vcenter{\xymatrix{
			(\clO^m)^\op \ar[rr]\ar[dr]&& [(\clT^n)^\op, \Set] \ar[dl]\\
			& [(\clO^m)^\op, \Set]
		}}
\]
is pseudocommutative, the composition $L\circ y$ s equal to (the mate of) $\fkK$. This means: $\clO$-models, when interpreted inside $\clT$-models, carry representations corrisponding to the observational tokens interpreted in $\clT$-models; that is, the representation is coherent over observational tokens, that is\dots
\begin{remark}[Ramseyfication and translation functors]\label{carnap_translation_functors}
	Assume that there exists an adjunction 
	\[ 
		F : \clO \leftrightarrows \clT : G
	\]
	between the theoretical and the observable. Following Carnap, we might assume that $F : \clO \hookleftarrow \clT$, and thus $G$ is a right translation functor for $(\clT, \clO)$.

	In these assumptions, given a higher Ramsey map $\fkK : \clO \times \clT \to \Set$ the function term
	\[\lambda \uO\uX . \fkK(\uO, \uX)\]
	can be pre-composed with $G$ obtaining
	\[\lambda \uT.\fkK(F\uT, \uT)\]
	whenever there is an adjunction $F : \clO \leftrightarrows \clT : G$ between the theoretical and the observable. We say that a translation adjunction $(F,G)$ is `$\fkK$-admissible' when there is an isomorphism $\fkK(F\uT,\uT')\cong\fkK(\uT,G\uT')$.

	% This, together with the fact that $F\dashv G$ iff $F^*\cong G_*$ iff $G^*\cong F_*$, suggests a fruitful intuition: in presence of a `botched isomorphism' between observational and theoretical, witnessed by the adjunction $(F,G)$, we consider the theoretical trace left by the (image under $F$ of the) observational tokens, so that the dependency of $\fkK$ from $\uT$ is `eliminated' by means of the adjunction.

	% Clearly, the opposite procedure is possible: the adjunction $(F,G)$ allows to consider the observational trace left by the image of a theoretical token $\uT$ under $G$, so that
	% \[ \exists \uX . \fkK(\uO, \uX) \equiv \lambda \uO.\fkK(G\uT, \uT) \]
