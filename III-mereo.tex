\begin{abstract}
  As it stands, mereology is just the internal language of the category of ordinals/cardinals.

  We outline a theory of ordinals/cardinals in every sufficiently structured category (e.g. in ever topos), to show how subtle the choice of axioms for a mereology can be, in terms of the internal and external properties of the ambient category (two-caued logic, being Boolean, IAC, having an infinite NNO\dots).

  This shall serve as a guidance to study the totality of mereological theories as a whole, instead of focusing on the study now of this, now of that explicit model, with peculiarities and limitations. Ideally, a ``mereological theory'' will be none other than the theory of ordinals in the internal language of a topos, and a ``mereotopological theory'' the theory of ordinals in the internal language of a geometric topos.
