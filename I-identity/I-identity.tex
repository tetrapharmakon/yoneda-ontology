\begin{abstract}
  The present paper is the first piece of a series whose aim is to develop an approach to ontology and metaontology through category theory. More in detail, we exploit the theory of \emph{elementary toposes} to purport the claim that a sound notion of existence canbe obtained once the ontological base is put in the \emph{internal language} that all categories possess.

  In the internal language of a topos, all first-order properties of an object can be modeled by a proposition $p : U \to\Omega$ to an object whose ``elements'' are the truth values that $p$ can assume. Each category, taken as a universe of discourse, yields its own $\Omega$, and thus its own set of trut values, and thus . This language is able to generalise in one go fuzzy logic, as suitable choices of $\clE$, and thus of $\Omega$, yield more vague truth values than the usual ``true'' or ``false'' of classical logic. 
  
  In maniera simile a ci√≤ che si fa col moto degli astri, il solid corpus of structural mathematics has nontrivial philosophical consequences and yields a useful language serving as practical foundation for at least some problems in ontology; as a test-bench for our theory, we propose a possible topos-theoretic solution of Borges' famous paradox of the nine copper coins, and of other seemingly paradoxical construction in Borges' literary work.
