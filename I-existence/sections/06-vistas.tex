Reached this point, the reader will agree with us that Borges' literary world underlies deep mathematical structure, and that this structure is best appreciated through elementary algebra, analysis and geometry (to assess the \emph{form} and \emph{measure} of the universe), and through category theory (to assess the inferential rules governing form and measure). This literary \emph{divertissement}, as naive as it may be, has nonetheless the power to show ontology can be made a quantitative theory. 

We can go further, discussing the --not so-- tangential connection that Borges' work has with classical idealism \emph{à la} Berkeley. With our \autoref{incendiata} in mind, we can safely say Borges has often been fascinated by, and mocked, classical idealism (see \cite{confutacion} for an example of how fascination and derision mix in the same essay). 

Even though endeavouring on such a wide ground as classical idealism isn't the purpose of our work, Borges regards \tlon's language and philosophy as a concrete realisation of Berkeley's theory of knowledge. We thus find natural to explore such link with a classical piece of philosophy, as far as it can be taken, with the eyes of a category theorist.

In the following subsections, we sketch a more wide-ranging plan; surely a less substantiated one, and yet aimed at laying a foundation for future work, ours or others', in a research track that we feel is fertile and promising.
\subsection{Answers to the idealist}\label{berkelei}
Let us reconsider \autoref{bla}; we have already mentioned Berkeley's famous view of experience as a perceptual bundle of stimuli that are incapable to cohere.

In whatever sense it accepts that there are nine coins, Berkeleyan instantaneism asks to cut every `non-total' existence $p(g,c,d) < (\top,1)$ at the purely false value, so that our notion of admissibility for a configuration of coins becomes untenable (because we can't have $(c,d) \entails{} \sum_u p(u,\firstblank)$ for every $(c,d)$). 

Only what exists completely deserves to be called being. On our side of the barricade however instantaneism is untenable.  Idealism is equally untenable, when the word is intended as `the belief that what lacks a percipient conscience must suddenly disappear in thin air' (and thus, to ensure the world to exist, there must be God).

However, as strange and counterintuitive as it may seem, instantaneism and idealism have their point on \tlon:\footnote{Somehow, \cite{tlonEN} isn't far from an artificial world built to mock idealism; cf. also \cite{borges1997otras} and the famous essay \cite{confutacion} therein.} we should then be able to find a tenable justification for both of them, possibly from within topos theory; possibly, `making no pact with the impostor Jesus Christ' (cf. \cite{tlonEN}).

In the internal language of variable sets $\Set/I$ a proposition $p$ takes its truth values in a much wide spectrum of values, as wide as $I$; thus, existence gives way to a more nuanced notion that can be (in)valid with a certain strength $t : I$. The language we introduced so far was precisely meant to quantify this stray from classical logic. 

Here, it is meant to quantify how much Berkeley's `cut' in \autoref{incendiata} is a blunt one, easily falsifiable (to say the least) even on \tlon.

To put it shortly, 
\begin{enumtag}{i} 
  \item instantaneism is what we get from the subobject classifier $\Omega_I$ forgetting the topology and order structure on $I$ (cf. \autoref{something_on_I}), and 
  \item idealism arises from quotienting one of the copy $I\times \{\top\}$ of $I\times \{\top,\perp\}$ to a point (cf. \autoref{fig_Omega}). 
\end{enumtag}
The problem is thus phrased in a way that makes its solution completely natural: just don't be a 18$^\text{th}$ century Irish empiricist; if the subobject classifier of a topos carries additional structure, don't forget it.

To fix ideas, let's consider an example. Let's say two empiricists, that for lack of a better name are called David and George, discuss about the truth of the proposition (say, $p$) `the World is there'. 

Let us assume that $p : U \to \Omega_I$ depends on a certain number of variables $\vec x$; now, when saying that closing their eyes the world disappears, David and George claim that $p(\eye,\firstblank) \neq p(\noeye,\firstblank)$, and even more, that $\entails{} \lnot p(\noeye,\firstblank)$. (Note that this is the strongest possible sense in which $p$ `is not true': for every context $x:U$, $p(\noeye, x) =(bot,1)$.) 

A certain number of implicit assumptions are already made here:
\begin{itemize} 
  \item First, that $p$'s domain of definition splits into a product $E\times U'$, where $E = \{\eye,\noeye\}$ is a space of parameters taking into account the state of George and David's eyes, and $U'$ takes into account `the rest of the world'; so $p$ is evaluated on pairs $(e,\vec y)$. 
  \item Second, that every force $p(\noeye,\vec y) < (\top,1)$ collapses to the minimum value `completelyy false' so that at any $(\noeye,\vec y)$ configuration the World is \emph{not} there. 
\end{itemize}
Formally, George and David collapsed a certain subset of the classifier $\Omega_I$ to a point, by means of a quotient map $Q$, pictorially represented as
\[
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[gray!70,dashed] (2,1.25) -- (2,-.25) node[below] {$\{\perp,\top\}$};
    \draw[fill] (0,0) circle (1pt) node[left] {$0$};
    \draw[fill] (2,0) circle (1pt) node[right] (dis) {$1$};
    \draw (0,0) -- (2,0);
    \begin{scope}[yshift=1cm]
      \draw[fill] (0,0) circle (1pt) node[left] {$0$};
      \draw[fill] (2,0) circle (1pt) node[right] (dat) {$1$};
      \draw (0,0) -- (2,0);
    \end{scope}
    \node at (3,.5) {$\overset{Q}\longrightarrow$};
    \begin{scope}[xshift=4cm]
      \fill[gray!20] (0,0) -| (2,1);
      \draw[gray!70,dashed] (2,1.25) -- (2,-.25) node[below] {$\{\perp,\top\}$};
      \draw[fill] (0,1) circle (1pt) node[left] {$0$};
      \draw[fill] (2,1) circle (1pt) node[right] (dis) {$1$};
      \draw (0,1) -- (2,1);
    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
(An even more drastic choice would have been to take just the fiber $\{\perp,\top\}\cong \{\perp,\top\}\times \{1\}$, thus falling into classical logic; but we have no information about George and David's stance on falsehood.)

Now, what happens at $p(\eye,\vec y)$, as opposed to what happens at $p(\noeye,\vec y)$? Strictly speaking, we can't rule out the possibility that perception is directly affected by observers (it certainly is on \tlon, in Babylon, or in a quantum mechanics laboratory); so, George and David closing their eyes somehow affects the degree of existence of the World. In what way? In classical logic the choice is forced by LEM; but making the right choice of a topos $\clE$ there can be even a large, even continuous, spectrum of different choices. So, the apparent paradox of idealism can be turned into a safe statement: observation --or lack thereof-- affects beings so that something changes between $p(\eye,\firstblank)$ and $p(\noeye,\firstblank)$. It does so in a complicated, perhaps even mysterious, but coherent, way.

Of course, the practice of rewording identity and persistence-in-time as mathematical notions affects natural language as well. When David and George close their eyes, they are tricked into believing that the World had disappeared. But this loss of information is merely induced by the drastic quotient map $Q$ above, deleting the set $Z^\top$ (cf. the notation in \autoref{alcuni_set}); on the contrary, if only David and George admitted that there is a continuous parameter (a `strength') modelling $p$'s truth in the sense defined here they would implicitly accept to move towards a nonclassical universe of discourse (a topos). All that follows from this `leap of faith' in nonclassical logic is mere calculation.

From inside \tlon, this gives way to the epistemic vision of its inhabitants, where each of $X,Y,Z$ does not know what happens to the coins of the other observers, and in what secret way $C$ exists as a global entity: without an awakening about the shape of their formal logic, the topos-theoretic model is unusable by \tlonians.

Even this superficial analysis is already sufficient to make our point, that George and David peculiar theory of existence isn't barred from our model; on the contrary, it arises as a very specific example of internal logic. How this is done, follows from a standard procedure in problem-solving:
\begin{itemize}
  \item First, identify the constraints forcing your choice of $I$ (`what logic shapes your $I$?' and vice versa `what $I$ best approximates the logic you want to describe?');
  \item Given an explicit description of $\Omega_I$, compute proposition strength (`where are you seeking $p$ to be true/false', and at which strength?)
\end{itemize}
Points of evaluation can be provided by a temporal, spatial or any other kind of reference whatsoever: we are completely agnostic towards the shape of space-time, towards the structure or the properties of the set it forms; moreover, every configuration respecting the prescribed constraints is `correct' from within the topos. Finally, our approach is computational: given the initial piece of data (for the nine coins: the observer, a subset of coins, a day of the week) all else necessarily follows from a calculation.

A last observation, to conclude the section: an additional source of agnosticism towards the structure of $I$ was anticipated in \autoref{existence}, and consists in the refusal to adopt a temporal logic framework; we can sometimes interpret the elements of $I$ as time instants, but this is not an obligation at all. A presentist, or a Borges' coherent idealist (capable to deduce from idealism the nonexistence of time, as in \cite{confutacion}) can establish the truth of $p$ without renouncing their ontological stance; they are just forced to accept the result of a calculation.

% We believe this intuitive approach to fuzzy logic through category theory has great potential for philosophical debate, as it fits George and David's counterintuitive perspective into a coherent frame, and it avoids the barren dichotomies in which the debate had stalled for a few centuries.
\subsection{Ye shall know them by their fruit}\label{frutti}
The main point of our paper can be summarised very concisely: an `ontology' is a category $\clO$, inside which `Being unravels'. Every existence theory shall be reported, and is relative, to a fixed ontology $\clO$, the `world we live in'; such existence theory coincides with the internal language $\clL(\clO)$ of the ontology/category (from now on we employ the two terms as synonyms), in a `syntax\hyp{}semantics like' adjunction of \cite{syntax-semantics_duality}.

So determined, the internal language of \autoref{da_lang} an ontology $\clO$ is the collection of `things that can be said' about the constituent parts of the ontology.

If, now, ontology is the study of Being, and if we are structuralist in the metatheory (cf. \autoref{sec_intro}), we cannot know beings but through their attributes. Secretly, this is just an instance of \emph{Yoneda lemma} (cf. \cite[1.3.3]{Bor1}), the statement that the totality of modes of understanding an object $X$ coincides with the totality of modes your language allows you to probe the object $X$. In relational structures, objects are known via their modes of interaction with other objects, and these are modelled as morphisms $U \to X$; Yoneda lemma posits that we shall `know objects by their morphisms' as we know types by the terms of that type: an object $X:\clC$ coincides with the totality of all morphisms $U\to X$, organised in a coherent `bundle' (a functor $\clC(\firstblank,X) : \clC \to \Set$).\footnote{The naming convention is not unfortunate: there is indeed a `bundle' over $\clC$, in an appropriate sense, whose fibers are the slices $\clC/X$, linked by re-indexing maps $f^* : \clC/Y \to \clC/X$, one for each $f : X\to Y$ in $\clC$.}

All in all, an ontology is a mode of understanding the attributes of Being: a category, be it in an Aristotelic or in a structuralist sense. As a consequence \emph{meta}ontology, i.e. the totality of such ways of understanding, must coincide with the general theory of such particular modes: with \emph{category theory}. One of the greatest merits of category theory is having provided Mathematics (not its history, not its philosophy,b ut its practice) with the technical tools to understand the opposition between general and particular.

We shall say no more on the matter, as every further discussion pertains to \emph{meta}ontology, and it would derange from an already wide-ranging discussion: let's just say that questions as `where is language' and what general principles inspire it might have an anthropological or even neurophysiological answer; not a purely ontological (=category-theoretic) one.

% Questions as `where is language' and what general principles inspire it might have an anthropological or even neurophysiological answer; not an ontological one. Or at least, not without paying a price: operative ontology as sketched here has limits. It can't speak of Being out of the one ignited by itself. (read as \emph{category theory has limits}: it cannot speak efficiently of objects out of a fixed universe of discourse. Implicit: category theory also has merits.)
\subsection{Metaontology} \label{metaon}
The gist of our \autoref{bla} is that $X,Y,Z$ can't assess the existence of the coins classically; they just have access to partial information allowing neither a global statement of existence on the set $C_X$ of coins lost by $X$, nor an unbiased claim about the meaning thereof. Lost coins in $C_X$ are untouched as a global conglomerate, yet their strength of existence is very likely to enjoy \emph{local} changes.

This begs the important questions of to which extent language determines ontology, to which extent it constrains its expressive power, and to which extent the inhabitants of \tlon fail to see what is exactly `a topos further' (e.g., persistence of existence through time).

Let us rewind a bit: according to Quine, ontology is the `domain over which [logical, or natural language's] quantifiers run'. This is not wrong; it is even perfectly compatible with our views. The only subtlety is that we raised the complexity one level up: in our framework, ontology \emph{à la} Quine still is a category, because (cf. \autoref{quantifezzi}) a quantifier can be described as a certain specific kind of functor
\[\forall,\exists : PX \to PY\]
between powersets regarded as \emph{internal} categories of our ambient ontology $\clO$; in light of this, it's easy to imagine this pattern to continue: if Quine calls metaontology what we call ontology, i.e. the metacategory grounding his propositional calculus is a single ambient category \emph{among many}, we live `one universe higher' in the cumulative hierarchy of foundations and meta-foundations: our ontology possesses a higher dimensionality, and harbours Quinean theory as an internal structure (see \autoref{internista} for the definition of an internal category). So, it shall exist, \emph{somewhere} -at least `in some secret way, hidden from the comprehension of men' \cite{Borges1963}- a language that calls ontology what we call metaontology (and thus a language that declassifies Quine's to a sub-ontology --whatever this prefix means).

Finding the bottom of this tower of turtles is the aim of the track of research, of very ancient tradition, within which we want to insert the present work.

Of course our work does not make a single comment on how, if, and when, this ambitious foundational goal can be achieved. We just find remarkable that framing Quine's definition in this bigger picture is not far from the so-called practice of `negative thinking' in category theory: the belief that a high-dimensional/complex entity can be understood through the analogy with its low-dimensional/complexity counterparts; see \cite{nlab:category-order,nlab:neg-think} for a minimal introduction to the principle, \cite{baez2010lectures} for a practical introduction, and see \cite{gowers2007} for what T. Gowers calls `backwards generalisation'.
\subsection{Conclusion}
The circle closes on, and motivates better, our initial foundational choice: categories and their theory correspond 1:1 to ontology and its theory. However, countless important issues remain open: in what sense this is satisfying? In what sense the scope of our analysis is not limited by this choice? What's his foundation? Is this a faithful way to describe such an elusive concept as `Being'?

None of these questions is naive; in fact, each legitimately pertains to metaontology and has no definitive answer. More or less our stance is as follows: approaching problems in ontology with a reasonable amount of mathematical knowledge is fruitful. Yet, the problem of what is a foundation for that Mathematics remains (fortunately!) wide open; it pertains to metaontology, whose ambitious effort is to clarify `what there is'. We believe the philosophers' job to work in synergy with quantitative knowledge, approaching the issue with complementary tools.
