> First of all, the paper is very long. Although we do not apply a strict page limit, I must warn you that if you think you cannot shorten this paper, finding reviewers to accept this task may take several months longer than average. Secondly, I would prefer you removed the `I' from the title. It happens too often that papers with a part I and part II lead to confusion: sometimes the part II never gets written, or part II gets accepted somewhere but not part I, etcetera.

We have addressed both issues: the paper lost a few pages; although the reference to other works in progress remained, the tag "part I" has been removed from the title.
